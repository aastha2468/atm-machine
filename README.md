# ATM Machine

This is a command-line program that is essentially a mini-bank. The programs allows users to select a bank, create a user or log in, and perform various bank related functions. Once logged in, the user can look at their accounts summary, look at the transaction history of a specific account, add an account, withdraw money from an account, deposit money to an account or transfer money to another account. Additionally, users can exit an action by typing "x".

## Usage

Running the main method in the ATM class will allow you to run the program. From there, enter in values as prompted.
